Organizations are adopting a new class of operational systems called Decision Management Systems to meet the demands of consumers, regulators and markets because traditional systems are too inflexible, fail to learn and adapt and crucially cannot apply analytics to take advantage of big data.

The purpose of our software is to build a proactive raccommendation system that analyzes data coming from different sources like social network..

Our software is build in Play framework using Scala as a programming language and OrientDB, a graph database that works perfectly with large amount of data(big data).
